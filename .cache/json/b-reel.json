{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h4>About</h4>\n<p>I spent the past summer in a paid internship with B-Reel in New York City. I primarily worked with the Development Team, helping to develop and design the implementation of components for clients such as AMEX and Quantcast. This was a great opportunity and incredible learning experience.</p>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"faux-link\" href=\"https://www.b-reel.com\">Visit their Site</a>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><em>My work at B-Reel is covered by an NDA, so I can't share visuals, code, designs or any other details publicly. Drop me an email if you'd like to know more and I'll get back to you asap.</em></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.jacobdfrank.com/images/breel/breelCouch.png\" alt=\"b-reel, people on a couch\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>What I learned</h4>\n<p>B-Reel taught me what the design and development lifecycle was like at an agency, how to finish projects and work alongside a professional design team instead. This process showed me how to effectively communicate as a designer and developer.</p>\n<p>I was also able to learn the JavaScript framework React on my own. Through experimentation and iteration, I learned a lot about the framework, as well as my own methods for learning software.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.jacobdfrank.com/images/breel/breelLogo.png\" alt=\"breelLogo\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>B-reel was a perfect learning environment for me. I was able to turn to professionals who could help me resolve difficult work. Instead of having to browse a Stack Overflow on my own, I was able to become more efficient and knowledgeable.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.jacobdfrank.com/images/breel/womenbreel.png\" alt=\"womenbreel\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>When the internship ended, I felt like I was leaving a family. However, I'm not sure Iâ€™ll miss implementing a custom-styled, accessible loading indicator that looks consistent across browsers - for a while.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/B-Reel","title":"B-Reel NYC Internship","description":"Spent summer 2017 at B-Reel NYC, Designing, Coding, and Learning","tags":"Internship / Creative Tech","volume":"2.5","homeImage":"breelCover","timePeriod":"Summer 2017"}}},"pathContext":{}}
