The first thing I did was gain an understanding of what a digital media company needs on a site and who they wanted to attract to the site.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"./images/hawkes/sketch1.jpg\" alt=\"sketches\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"./images/hawkes/Hawkes_Mindmap.png\" alt=\"mindmap\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>Designing the Site</h4>\n<p>I created sketches on paper of a simple interface with a consistent layout.

This was followed by higher fidelity wireframes. Taking all these steps made for fewer changes as we moved ahead because the feedback helped me remove what the client didn’t like. The triangles and diagonal styling I used on the header and footer to give the site more character were stripped away and the Merriweather font was changed to a more plain and modern looking Open Sans typeface.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"./images/hawkes/hmg-work.png\" alt=\"their work page\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>Coding</h4>\n<p>During the development of the site I found a way to give the client access to a CMS so that they could collaborate and make minor changes using Webflow.
