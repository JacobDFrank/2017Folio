the Brand</h4>\n<p>Hawkes Media Group is a full-service digital media production company based near Boston, Massachusetts.

This was followed by higher fidelity wireframes. Taking all these steps made for fewer changes as we moved ahead because the feedback helped me remove what the client didn’t like. The triangles and diagonal styling I used on the header and footer to give the site more character were stripped away and the Merriweather font was changed to a more plain and modern looking Open Sans typeface.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"./images/hawkes/hmg-work.png\" alt=\"their work page\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>Coding</h4>\n<p>During the development of the site I found a way to give the client access to a CMS so that they could collaborate and make minor changes using Webflow.

This process showed me how to effectively communicate as a designer and developer.</p>\n<p>I was also able to learn the JavaScript framework React on my own. Through experimentation and iteration, I learned a lot about the framework, as well as my own methods for learning software.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.jacobdfrank.com/images/breel/breelLogo.png\" alt=\"breelLogo\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>B-reel was a perfect learning environment for me. I was able to turn to professionals who could help me resolve difficult work. Instead of having to browse a Stack Overflow on my own, I was able to become more efficient and knowledgeable.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.jacobdfrank.com/images/breel/womenbreel.png\" alt=\"womenbreel\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>When the internship ended, I felt like I was leaving a family.

Their need for a new website was urgent. One of their staff tried to create a new website 6 months earlier, but was too busy to complete it.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.jacobdfrank.com/images/hawkes/contact.png\" alt=\"contact page\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>Assessing the Problem</h4>\n<p>Compared to their old, busy-looking site, the client wanted to showcase their work in a much simpler, direct and focused way. The first thing I did was gain an understanding of what a digital media company needs on a site and who they wanted to attract to the site.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.jacobdfrank.com/images/hawkes/sketch1.jpg\" alt=\"sketches\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.jacobdfrank.com/images/hawkes/Hawkes_Mindmap.png\" alt=\"mindmap\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>Designing the Site</h4>\n<p>I created sketches on paper of a simple interface with a consistent layout. Then I created wireframes for each page. I also used a mind map and information architecture I’d created to guide me along the way.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.jacobdfrank.com/images/hawkes/clients__wires.png\" alt=\"wireframes\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>Once the wireframes were finished I made a low-fidelity prototype and showed it to the client for feedback. This was followed by higher fidelity wireframes. Taking all these steps made for fewer changes as we moved ahead because the feedback helped me remove what the client didn’t like. The triangles and diagonal styling I used on the header and footer to give the site more character were stripped away and the Merriweather font was changed to a more plain and modern looking Open Sans typeface.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.jacobdfrank.com/images/hawkes/hmg-work.png\" alt=\"their work page\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>Coding</h4>\n<p>During the development of the site I found a way to give the client access to a CMS so that they could collaborate and make minor changes using Webflow. The project was developed using custom code that I would paste into the Webflow editor along with editor itself for a couple smaller things. CSS Flexbox was used for most of the site and it saved a lot of time with layout. JQuery was also used on some items like the mobile navigation.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>Check it Out</h4>\n<p>The current website can be seen <a class=\"faux-link\" href=\"http://www.hawkesmediagroup.com/\">here</a>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe old site's homepage is below</p>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.jacobdfrank.com/images/hawkes/oldScreenCap.jpg\" alt=\"their work page\"></p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-5b3d437621631b15a844d8e3634a0459--","value":"<h4>The Project</h4>\n<p>Creation of a design conference website.

Building on what I learned as the lead developer on Thought at Work 2016, I formed a team with the best designers and developers at RIT.

We used a combination of Bootstrap, our own custom CSS, PHP, JavaScript for some interactions, and JQuery for a handful of animations. I developed most of the site at first. As other people came on board, I took on a additional managerial role for the entire website and became the lead for the project.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.jacobdfrank.com/images/taw/history.png\" alt=\"history\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>Responsivity</h4>\n<p>At first we were only given desktop mocks for the site. Two months later we got a mobile mock of the homepage. Without a tablet mock I translated the desktop site to tablet and mobile without compromising the original style and flow of the site content. From a visual perspective the site lost some of its more interesting aspects. But it retained much of the way the content was laid out and that’s what mattered most.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.jacobdfrank.com/images/taw/mobileScreens.png\" alt=\"mobileScreens\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.jacobdfrank.com/images/taw/Ipad_screen.png\" alt=\"Ipad_screen\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>Performance</h4>\n<p>We encountered another challenge very close to the start of the conference. We were given headshots to create a volunteer/team section on the ‘about’ page.
