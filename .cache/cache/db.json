We used a combination of Bootstrap, our own custom CSS, PHP, JavaScript for some interactions, and JQuery for a handful of animations. I developed most of the site at first. As other people came on board, I took on a additional managerial role for the entire website and became the lead for the project.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"./images/taw/history.png\" alt=\"history\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>Responsivity</h4>\n<p>At first we were only given desktop mocks for the site. Two months later we got a mobile mock of the homepage. Without a tablet mock I translated the desktop site to tablet and mobile without compromising the original style and flow of the site content. From a visual perspective the site lost some of its more interesting aspects. But it retained much of the way the content was laid out and that’s what mattered most.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"./images/taw/mobileScreens.png\" alt=\"mobileScreens\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"./images/taw/Ipad_screen.png\" alt=\"Ipad_screen\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>Performance</h4>\n<p>We encountered another challenge very close to the start of the conference. We were given headshots to create a volunteer/team section on the ‘about’ page.

What it meant to throw it away, what it meant to use it. I went through every avenue looking for a possible problem that I could address to people with my poster.

I ended up creating a set of posters that I wasn't very happy and it left me feeling confused. Where did I go wrong? Why does this all look like, well, like shit? So I took a step back and looked at more inspiration. What did people like Massimo Vignelli figure out so easily and understand that I couldn't scratch the surface of? I ended up iterating and just making crap, lots of crap.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"./images/pills/1stRound.png\" alt=\"1st draft for project\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"./images/pills/horiz.png\" alt=\"set of iterations\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>Learn by studying the best</h4>\n<p>My final set of posters were by far better than my first, second, third, etc, and yet they still aren't special.

There's a lot of things I wish I'd done better on this project but that doesn't  matter as much compared to what I've taken away from it.

This was followed by higher fidelity wireframes. Taking all these steps made for fewer changes as we moved ahead because the feedback helped me remove what the client didn’t like. The triangles and diagonal styling I used on the header and footer to give the site more character were stripped away and the Merriweather font was changed to a more plain and modern looking Open Sans typeface.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"./images/hawkes/hmg-work.png\" alt=\"their work page\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>Coding</h4>\n<p>During the development of the site I found a way to give the client access to a CMS so that they could collaborate and make minor changes using Webflow.
