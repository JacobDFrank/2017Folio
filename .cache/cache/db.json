Building on what I learned as the lead developer on Thought at Work 2016, I formed a team with the best designers and developers at RIT. Our team was made up of 12 students; 7 designers, 5 developers. My responsibilities consist of, but are not limited to: Managing the team; Leading design/development meetings; Working on design deliverables; And writing code for development.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"./images/taw/contact.png\" alt=\"contact\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>Some Comps for the 2017 site are below</h4>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"./images/taw/speakers-comp.jpg\" alt=\"speakers comp\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"./images/taw/register-comp.jpg\" alt=\"register comp\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>Thought at Work 2016</h4>\n<p>Completed the development of a design conference website.

We used a combination of Bootstrap, our own custom CSS, PHP, JavaScript for some interactions, and JQuery for a handful of animations. I developed most of the site at first. As other people came on board, I took on a additional managerial role for the entire website and became the lead for the project.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"./images/taw/history.png\" alt=\"history\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>Responsivity</h4>\n<p>At first we were only given desktop mocks for the site. Two months later we got a mobile mock of the homepage. Without a tablet mock I translated the desktop site to tablet and mobile without compromising the original style and flow of the site content. From a visual perspective the site lost some of its more interesting aspects. But it retained much of the way the content was laid out and thatâ€™s what mattered most.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"./images/taw/mobileScreens.png\" alt=\"mobileScreens\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"./images/taw/Ipad_screen.png\" alt=\"Ipad_screen\"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>Performance</h4>\n<p>We encountered another challenge very close to the start of the conference. We were given headshots to create a volunteer/team section on the â€˜aboutâ€™ page. We had to display dozens of people with their name and major without losing much performance and load time.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src=\"./images/taw/team.png\" alt=\"2016 team page\"></p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-9503b764880b58df9f0bf08c646a35c0--","value":"<p>Learn new skills.
