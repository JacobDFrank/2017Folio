The project was really just an exercise in ui design but I wanted to go a bit harder. The problem was simple based on numerous <a href="https://qz.com/1179937/hawaii-missile-alert-blame-terrible-interface-design-for-the-hawaii-debacle/"><strong>articles</strong></a>  showing how the Hawaii missle alert threat was the fault of bad design.</p>\n<br/>\n<a class="faux-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.jacobdfrank.com/assets/misslePrototype/index.html#/screens">Use the prototype</a>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src="./images/missle/selectScreen.png" alt="select screen"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>What I learned</h4>\n<p>This project was a lot of fun and my main goal for it was to craft a solid visual style since I\'ve never done that before.</p>\n<p>I also decided later on in the project that I should make small. I realized how much and to what scale I wanted this project to be so instead of getting myself anxious I decided to scale down and be okay with it.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src="./images/missle/redSelect.png" alt="selecting a type of alert to send"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>While researching for this project I started with looking up as much as I could learn about the reaction to it. I found about 10 different articles discussing design in relation to the incident. The big thing I learned from all of these was designing with friction for the user in mind.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src="./images/missle/flow-p1v2.png" alt="My user flow"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>Sketches</h4>\n<p>For my sketches I stuck with what I knew but also started learning about the backend of the system I was redesigining. It turns out this whole project was really just a design for a software that interacted with a government API called IPAWS.</p>\n<p><a class="faux-link" href="https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1463674830481-16ed0020684ba8cd263ba88f54a48c95/TemplateEmergencyCommPlans_IPAWS-508_05192016.pdf">Learn about IPAWS here</a></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><img src="./images/missle/SketchesV1-5.JPG" alt="sketches">\n<img src="./images/missle/SketchesV1-1.JPG" alt="sketches"></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h4>The Rest</h4>\n<p>All my screens are in the prototype but here\'s a couple if you don\'t wanna click the dang link.</p>\n<p><img src="./images/missle/map.png" alt="other comps">\n<img src="./images/missle/false.png" alt="other comps">\n<img src="./images/missle/false2.png" alt="other comps">\n<img src="./images/missle/end.png" alt="other comps"></p>',frontmatter:{path:"/missle",title:"Emergency Alert System",description:"Created a prototype for an alert system following the Hawaii false alarm",tags:"School / Design",volume:"2.8",homeImage:"missleCover",timePeriod:"2 Weeks"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
